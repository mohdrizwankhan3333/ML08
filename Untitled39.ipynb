    "### Q1: Difference Between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression: Involves one independent variable to predict a dependent variable.  \n",
    "Example: Predicting salary based on years of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression: Involves multiple independent variables to predict a dependent variable.  \n",
    "Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Assumptions of Linear Regression and Checking Them\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: Relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
    "2. Independence: Observations are independent.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of errors.\n",
    "4. Normality: Errors are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking: Residual plots, Durbin-Watson test, Q-Q plots, and statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Interpreting Slope and Intercept in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope: Change in dependent variable for a one-unit change in independent variable.  \n",
    "Intercept: Value of dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Predicting height from age: Slope shows height increase per year, intercept is height at age zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Concept of Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent: Optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function by iteratively updating parameters in \n",
    "the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "Use in Machine Learning: To find the optimal parameters of models like linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression: Predicts a dependent variable using multiple independent variables.  \n",
    "Difference: Unlike simple linear regression, it accounts for multiple factors influencing the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Multicollinearity in Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: When independent variables are highly correlated, causing instability in coefficient \n",
    "estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), correlation matrix.  \n",
    "Addressing: Removing correlated predictors, combining variables, or regularization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: Polynomial Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression: Fits a nonlinear relationship by transforming variables into polynomial terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference: Unlike linear regression, it can model curves by including higher-degree terms of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: Advantages and Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: Can model complex, nonlinear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: Prone to overfitting, computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferred Use: When the relationship between variables is nonlinear and cannot be captured by linear \n",
    "regression."
